# Removr

## Overview And Main Idea
The concept behind this project was to create a Grammarly / Pro Writing Aid clone of sorts. One which is built to my specific specifications- and is absolutely free! Or something like that. We'll see how far we get.

### I. Project Information

1. Technologies Used:
    - ElectronJS
        - electron packager?
    - NodeJS
    - Javascript (of course)
    - ??? ... etc   

2. Goals:
- There should be a way to toggle on and off spell check and grammar checks.
- Mainly an adverb detector, I guess...
- Also, if there are libraries available, perhaps determining parts of speech that are used incorrectly.
- Toggle the type of tense one is using!
- DIALOG DETECTOR. Anything in dialog or rather within double quotes, would be largely ignored for the sake of language and dialect.
- ?????

### II. Outline of Requirements
1. Text Editor / App. Not particularly for writing, but for checking writing.
2. Standalone App, perhaps integrations in the future?

### III. To Dos / Task List
 - [x] Create Git Repository
 - [ ] Build a Basic Text Editor
    - [ ] Find proper packages
    - [ ] Libraries for syntax and grammar detection [^1]
    - [ ] Code the first versions of a basic text editor!
 - [ ] Incorporate external libraries to search for grammar and syntax...
 - [ ] ???

### IV. Design Concepts
Design ideas for the app, and how it will
generally function I suppose?
